# Industry 4.0 Integration for Dardi Water Jet Cutting Machines

**Description:**

Welcome to the repository for the Industry 4.0 system designed for the Dardi water jet cutting machine! This project represents an exciting step forward in automating and monitoring industrial processes, leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as the ESP32, current sensors, IMU, encoder, and a Raspberry Pi to provide enhanced control and supervision.

**Key Features:**

* **ESP32 and Advanced Sensors:** We harness the power of the ESP32 in combination with current sensors, an IMU, and an encoder to gather precise data from the water jet cutting process.
* **Raspberry Pi with Interactive GUI:** The Raspberry Pi hosts a graphical user interface (GUI) that enables operators to intuitively monitor and control the cutting process.
* **AWS Connectivity:** All collected data is processed and stored in Amazon Web Services (AWS), enabling access to critical information anytime, anywhere.

**Project Objectives:**

Our main objective is to improve the efficiency and quality of the Dardi water jet cutting process by implementing Industry 4.0 technologies. We aim to provide operators with a powerful tool to monitor and optimize operations as well as to make informed decisions.

**Repository Structure:**

* **Source Code:** Find the source code here for both the ESP32 and the Raspberry Pi.
* **Documentation:** Detailed documentation describing the setup, operation, and components of the system.
* **Additional Resources:** Helpful links and resources related to Industry 4.0, AWS, and more.
